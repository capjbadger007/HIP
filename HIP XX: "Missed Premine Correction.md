Bulletpoint outline of the core ideas for HIP XX: "Missed Premine Correction"

1. A multisig wallet will be created to fund awarding qualifying hotspots that were not awarded during the IOT premine.
2. Each qualifying hotspot will be awarded pro rata share of the donation wallet up to 5789.755 IOT tokens, transferred to the wallet that owned the hotspot at of the time of the original premine award (xx:xx UTC)
3. The funds wallet will be funded with donations from any source that chooses to add to the fund over a period of 14 epochs. Any extra funds will be burnt, and the wallet's keys will be disposed.
4. The multisig wallet will require 2 out of 3 signatures to distribute funds. (Suggested signatures: Helium Foundation, trusted community person, and ?)
5. For clarity, HIP will have a list of hotspots to be awarded.
6. Query to generate list can be found at https//:.... for community verification.
7. After the passage of the HIP (time of vote closure), no further claims can be made for these missed premine awards (AKA, if you're missing the premine, check to make sure you're on the list)
